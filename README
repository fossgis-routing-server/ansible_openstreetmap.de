This is the Ansible repository for the FOSSGIS Server Admin Working group.
It contains provisioning playbooks for machines that are administrated by
the group.

Testing
=======

The repo contains configuration files for [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
that may be used to test playbooks during development. To use it, you need
to install Vagrant and the lib-virt provider:

    apt install vagrant vagrant-libvirt libvirt-daemon

Spin up the test machine:

    vagrant up

This spins up a Debian Bullseye machine and sets up accounts, so that Ansible
can access the machine via the root account.

Next you need an inventory:

    ./init-vagrant-inventory.sh

This creates a file vagrant.ini with the right connection IP. Edit the file
to put the vagrant test machine into the group you want to test.

Now you can run the global playbook:

     ansible-playbook -i vagrant.ini site.yml

Additional hints:

* You may have to rerun `init-vagrant-inventory.sh` when you destroy and rebuild
  the Vagrant test machine to update the IP.
* If you are not in the admin user group, you can still run the playbook
  under the vagrant user: `ansible-playbook -i vagrant.ini -u vagrant site.yml`
